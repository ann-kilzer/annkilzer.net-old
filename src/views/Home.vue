      My name is Ann Kilzer. I'm a polymath, and my career is in software engineering.
      I am the Lead Software Engineer at blockchain-as-a-service startup Curvegrid.
      I received my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin,
      where I spent a few years researching privacy. I grew up in Missoula, Montana, and
      attended college at Gonzaga University, where I majored in computer science, math,
      and art. I moved to Japan in early 2018 with no job, just an eager dream of living abroad.
      In my spare time, I enjoy Japanese Calligraphy (Shodo), Nihonga painting, and
      riding slow trains around Japan.
